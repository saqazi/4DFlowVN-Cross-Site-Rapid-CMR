# 4DFlowVN Cross Site Rapid CMR

Code and Trained Network for **FlowVN trained on a single dataset enables rapid 4D Flow CMR across multiple sites**  

ðŸ“Œ **About this Repository**  
This repository is associated with our manuscript: **"FlowVN trained on a single dataset enables rapid 4D Flow CMR across multiple sites"** (Under Review)

Thisresearch investigates the application of FlowVN, a deep learning-based reconstruction method for 4D Flow MRI, focusing on its generalization across different acquisition sites and its performance when trained on a single dataset. By evaluating key hemodynamic parameters such as velocity, flow volume, and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) across multiple acceleration factors, we assess the modelâ€™s stability and accuracy in reconstructing highly undersampled data. This study highlights the potential of training deep learning models with minimal data while ensuring reliable and high-quality 4D Flow MRI reconstructions, paving the way for faster clinical adoption and multi-site applicability.  
  
ðŸ“¢ **Coming Soon:**  
Once the manuscript is officially published, this repository will include:  
- Full implementation of the updated FlowVN Model  
-  Pre-trained model for easy reproducibility  
-  Code to generate dummy data for training  
-  Instructions for running and reproducing results  

ðŸ“… **Expected Release:**  
The code and trained network will be made available upon publication. Stay tuned for updates!
