Code and Trained Network for [FlowVN trained on a single dataset enables rapid 4D Flow CMR across multiple sites]

📌 About this Repository
This repository is associated with our manuscript:
➡ "[FlowVN trained on a single dataset enables rapid 4D Flow CMR across multiple sites]" (Under Review)

We implemeted the 4D FlowVN [briefly describe your method, e.g., a deep learning-based 4D Flow MRI reconstruction using FlowVN], demonstrating improvements in [mention key improvements, e.g., reconstruction speed, accuracy, generalization, etc.].

📢 Coming Soon
Once the manuscript is officially published, this repository will include:
✅ Full implementation of the updated FlowVN Model
✅ Pre-trained model for easy reproducibility
✅ Code to generate dummy data for training
✅ Instructions for running and reproducing results

📅 Expected Release
The code and trained network will be made available upon publication. Stay tuned for updates!
